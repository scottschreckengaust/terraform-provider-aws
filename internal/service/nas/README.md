# Terraform AWS Provider Not-A-Service (NAS) Package
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD026 -->
This area is primarily for AWS provider contributors and maintainers. For information on _using_ Terraform and the AWS provider, see the links below.


The NAS package is not an AWS service. The NAS package is where we put resources or data sources that are not directly related to a specific AWS service.
